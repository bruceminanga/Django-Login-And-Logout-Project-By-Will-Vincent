# Django Login and Logout Project By Will Vincent

In this tutorial we'll learn how to configure login/logout functionality with Django's the built-in user authentication system. This is the first in a three-part series that also covers signup and password reset for a complete user authentication flow in your future Django projects.This tutorial assumes you're already familiar with how to configure a new Django project.
